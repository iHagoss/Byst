define({'3-point bending':{d:'3-point bending achieves a repeatable and highly accurate angle setting using the V-shaped system. The bend angle is determined by the two entry edges, the bottom tool and the channel floor of the bottom tool. The 3 points lie on the same side of the sheet. The angle is set using height-adjustable stops in the bottom tool. The hydro cushion compensates for deformation by the ram. Each of the segmented top tools works autonomously against the hydro cushion and is protected against overload. The bending process is not complete until the material lies on the channel floor of the bottom tool, and the top tool is submerged in the hydro cushion.',l:''},'75% rule':{d:'If «3-point» is selected as the bending method, the load on a tool segment must equal 75% minimum. If this minimum value is not met, the hydro cushion on the 3-point bending machine can sustain permanent damage. If the load cannot be increased to at least 75% owing to the use of another segment, the bending method must be set to Air bending.',l:''},'Air bending':{d:'With this bending method, the bending part is pressed into the bottom tool by the top tool. The workpiece shape is essentially determined by the relative position of the tools. Different bend angles are obtained by setting different penetration depths of the top tool into the bottom tool.',l:''},'Angle measurement system':{d:'The angle measurement system minimizes the material-dependent variations in the bend angle during the bending process. This ensures that excellent angle precision is maintained over the entire length of the part.',l:''},'Auxiliary bend':{d:'The auxiliary bend is temporarily inserted for certain bend shapes, and then bent back again, to allow the final shape of the bending part to be achieved.',l:''},'Bend':{d:'The bend is an element of the profile programming and designates a change in shape of the workpiece. A number of attributes can be assigned to a bend: side length, bend angle, bend radius (optional), initial-bend angle (optional), additional attributes (optional). A bend can consist of several bending processes.',l:''},'Bend allowance':{d:'The reduction in the side length for bends made on the bending part is called a bend allowance. Bending causes the part to be stretched in a longitudinal direction. Therefore the length of the side of a bend must be reduced again by this amount in the cutting part. The bend allowance, i.e. shortening of the side length, compensates for this stretching.',l:''},'Bend line':{d:'A bend line refers to a line along which the side is bent.',l:''},'Bend zone':{d:'Area around a bend line that is deformed by bending a radius.',l:''},'Bending method':{d:'3-point bending, air bending and coining are referred to as bending methods.',l:''},'Bending process':{d:'All actions or procedures that are needed for bending one or more bends are referred to as the bending process.',l:''},'Bending sequence':{d:'The bending sequence refers to the specific order in which all the bending edges on a part are implemented. A bending part can usually be bent using a number of different bending sequences. When the bending sequence is set automatically, the software works out the optimum bending sequence and then assigns it to the bending part.',l:''},'Bending station':{d:'A bending station always comprises a top bending tool and bottom bending tool and is included in a station plan.',l:''},'Coining':{d:'Open-die and closed-die coining is the most precise bending method. The shape and the bend angle are set by the geometry of the top and bottom tools. The extremely high pressing forces that are required increase the wear on the press brake.',l:''},'Contact edge':{d:'The edge on the bending part that is pressed against a stop point on the backgauge finger for precise positioning.',l:''},'Corner reliefs':{d:'Corner reliefs are notches made cut in the material at the ends of bend lines. They are needed to reduce deformation at the ends of the bends as a result of stretching and compression of material.',l:''},'Crowning':{d:'A system for compensating for deviations that can be traced to deflection of the top and bottom tool during the bending process.',l:''},'Empty segment':{d:'An empty segment is an area within a bending station that is defined as vacant. Empty segments are used for connected bend lines between two sides when there is a contour between the sides that must not be bent. An empty segment must always be bounded by two normal segments.',l:''},'Entry zone':{d:'Shows the area around a bend line that is equal to the size of the aperture of the bottom tool. If an inner contour lies within this zone, it may be deformed. This deformation can be avoided by making a strain relief cut in front of the inner contour.',l:''},'Hemming':{d:'This bend type bends the sheet over flat with a bend angle of 180°. The bending action is completed in two consecutive steps of «Pre-bend» and Hem. These steps may also be performed separately from one another.',l:''},'Horn':{d:'A horn is a top tool whose tool holder on the left or right side is shorter than the length of the tool tip that is used for bending.',l:''},'Hydro cushion':{d:'The hydro cushion compensates for deformation of the top and bottom beams during the bending process, thus enabling repeatable bend angles that are constant over the entire bend length. The hydro cushion dispenses with the need for crowning. The hydro cushion is only used on 3-point press brakes.',l:''},'Inlet radius':{d:'The radius of the curve running from the upper edge to the inner contour of the bottom tool.',l:''},'LAMS':{d:'See Angle measurement system',l:''},'Normal bending':{d:'Normal bending is the standard method for creating a bend. Bending is defined by the bend angle and an optional initial-bend angle.',l:''},'Peripherals axes':{d:'Peripherals axes is the term used to denote backgauges, bending aids and angle measurement systems that can be moved automatically on a press brake.',l:''},'Pre-bending':{d:'This bend type creates a bend in two steps. The bend is first made with an initial-bend angle and then the finished bend is made later with a final angle. Use pre-bending for complex bending parts to avoid collisions during the bending process.',l:''},'Retraction':{d:'Retraction refers to the backwards movement of the backgauge arm that is required to avoid the backgauge finger colliding with the bending part. Retraction is performed once the bending part has been clamped between top and bottom tools.',l:''},'Segment':{d:'A segment is a bending tool that is used as a bending station or part of a bending station.',l:''},'Setup plan':{d:'The tool setup plan contains at least one station plan. Each station plan in turn consists of at least one bending station on which the bending part is bent. All the tools for the whole bending process are defined in one tool setup plan.',l:''},'Side length':{d:'The side length is the perpendicular length measured from the bend line to the outer contour of the bending part.',l:''},'Snap on':{d:'To snap on means to set the backgauge finger against a contact edge or a corner.',l:''},'Station':{d:'A station consists of one or more segments of a top tool and a bottom tool.',l:''},'Station plan':{d:'See setup plan',l:''},'Stepped radius':{d:'A stepped radius bend is made when the angle and radius of a bent side is achieved by making a number of individual bends.',l:''},'Stop point':{d:'Refers to a point or surface on the backgauge finger that can be used as a stop for a contact edge.',l:''},'Tongue':{d:'A tongue refers to a bend whose bend line, when extended, runs along a contour.',l:''}});
